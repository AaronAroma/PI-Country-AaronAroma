            "Hello, my name is Aaron Aroma, and I'm originally from Utah, United
            States, but I've been living in Argentina since I was 4 years old.
            I'm passionate about web development and have been studying at
            SoyHenry. In my free time, I enjoy engaging in sports and furthering
            my studies. I firmly believe in hard work and always strive to be
            the best at what I do. I am constantly on the lookout for
            opportunities to grow personally and professionally. If you have any
            opportunities or just want to chat, feel free to get in touch with
            me!"
